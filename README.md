Release Belt is a Composer repository, which serves to quickly integrate third party non–Composer releases into Composer workflow. Once Release Belt is installed and you upload your zip files with their respected version number, Release Belt does the rest.

Given the following folder tree:

```
releases
	wordpress-plugin
		rarst
			plugin.1.0.zip
```

It will serve the following Composer repository at `/packages.json` automagically:

```json
{
    "packages": {
        "rarst/plugin": {
            "1.0": {
                "name": "rarst/plugin",
                "version": "1.0",
                "dist": {
                    "url": "http://example.com/rarst/plugin.1.0.zip",
                    "type": "zip"
                },
                "type": "wordpress-plugin",
                "require": {
                    "composer/installers": "~1.0"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Installation

### 1. Create the project:

```
composer create-project rarst/release-belt
```

### 2. Place release ZIPs into `/releases/[type]/[vendor]/`. 
`[type]` could be e.g. "library", "wordpress-plugin", and "wordpress-theme"

### 3. Configure a web server to serve `index.php`

For example with the following `.htaccess`:

```
FallbackResource /index.php
```

If your server does not support FallbackResource, you can use mod_rewrite in your `.htaccess` with this code:

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

Visit `index.php` and `packages.json` in a web browser to check if it is working

When using the built in webserver of PHP >=5.4.0 you can use:

```
php -S localhost:8000 index.php
```

## Use

Once Release Belt is installed you can add the repository to the `composer.json` of your projects.

Release Belt home page will automatically generate some `composer.json` boilerplate for you to use.

### Configuration

You can configure Release Belt by creating `config.php` file, which returns array of options to override.

For example:

```php
<?php

// config.php

return [
    'debug' => true,  
];
```

### Authentication

Release Belt implements HTTP authentication to password protect your repository. You can configure it by adding `http.users` array to configuration, which holds `'login' => 'password hash'` pairs.

For example:

```php
<?php

// config.php

return [
    'http.users' => [
        'composer' => '$2y$10$3i9/lVd8UOFIJ6PAMFt8gu3/r5g0qeCJvoSlLCsvMTythye19F77a',
    ],
];
```

There is an `encodePassword.php` command line helper included for hashing passwords:

```bash
>php encodePassword.php foo
$2y$10$3i9/lVd8UOFIJ6PAMFt8gu3/r5g0qeCJvoSlLCsvMTythye19F77a
```

If authentication is enabled, Release Belt home page will automatically generate `auth.json` boilerplate for you to use.

## F.A.Q.

### Why not Packagist/Satis?

Composer infrastructure is awesome, but it expects vendors that are willing to play nice with it.

Release Belt is a solution for unwilling vendors and it was faster and easier to build a dedicated solution from scratch. 

### Why not artifacts?

Composer artifacts require `composer.json` in them. This is for releases that don't even have that.

### But is it web scale?

No.

## Troubleshooting

### When I visit packages.json in a browser I get a 404 message
* Make sure, that you went through the installation procedure (see above)
* Maybe you need to change the FTP-Permissions of the folder which contains `index.php`
