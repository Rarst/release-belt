# Release Belt — Composer repo for ZIPs

Release Belt is a prototype Composer repository, which serves to quickly integrate third party non–Composer releases into Composer workflow. Once Release Belt is installed and you upload your zip files with their respected version number, Release Belt does the rest.

Given the following folder tree:

```
releases
	wordpress-plugin
		yoast
			wordpress-seo.1.6.zip
			wordpress-seo.1.7.zip
```

It will serve the following Composer repository at `/packages.json` automagically:

```json
{
    "packages": {
		"yoast/wordpress-seo": {
            "1.6": {
                "name": "yoast/wordpress-seo",
                "version": "1.6",
                "dist": {
                    "url": "http://example.com/yoast/wordpress-seo.1.6.zip",
                    "type": "zip"
                },
                "type": "wordpress-plugin",
                "require": {
                    "composer/installers": "~1.0"
                }
            },
            "1.7": {
                "name": "yoast/wordpress-seo",
                "version": "1.7",
                "dist": {
                    "url": "http://example.com/yoast/wordpress-seo.1.7.zip",
                    "type": "zip"
                },
                "type": "wordpress-plugin",
                "require": {
                    "composer/installers": "~1.0"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Installation (basic as–is usage for now)

Create the project:

```
composer create-project rarst/release-belt:dev-master
```

Place release ZIPs into `/releases/[type]/[vendor]/`.

Configure a web server to serve `index.php`, for example with the following `.htaccess`:

```
FallbackResource /index.php
```

If you are forcing HTTPS with something like 
```
RewriteEngine On 
RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on
RewriteRule .* https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]
```

then you should also add
```
DirectoryIndex index.php
```

When using the built in webserver of PHP >=5.4.0 you can use:

```
php -S localhost:8000 index.php
```

Release Belt DOES NOT have authentication implemented yet. Secure it via your web server if you dare to put it into the wild in its current state. 

## Use

Once Release Belt is installed you can define the repository and plugin in the `composer.json` of your project

```json
{
	"repositories": [
		{
			"type": "composer",
			"url": "http://example.com/"
		}
	],
	"require": {
		"yoast/wordpress-seo": "*"
	}
}
```

## F.A.Q.

### Why not Packagist/Satis?

Composer infrastructure is awesome, but it expects vendors that are willing to play nice with it.

Release Belt is a solution for unwilling vendors and it was faster and easier to build a prototype from scratch. 

### Why not artifacts?

Composer artifacts require `composer.json` in them. This is for releases that don't even have that.

### But is it web scale?

No.
